<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Tuan Luong - Group Leader</b></h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Throughout the group, I feel that the group worked extremely well and very effectively. The group members have clearly understood their roles and what they had to do to. As the group leader, I ensured that each group member has received a fair share of work in their area and expertise. For example, one member was quite proficient at making videos, so other team members made rough videos, while the third helped make the official one and helped the other two put the draft video and storyboard up onto RMIT Canvas.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The group’s communication was excellent, the group continued to be very supportive and positive in their interactions with each other. The group used a variety of means of communication, such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, messaging each other, group chats, individual or two to three people chats. The group helped each other with assignment parts given out, with positive suggestions made, contributions given, and ideas exchanged. As a leader, I offered help to group members that are struggling with the workload and lending a hand each way. At no time was there any tension in the group, and the group made sure every voice and opinion was heard.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">One thing that could be improved is using GitHub or other processes of sharing files, because as a group we mainly uploaded the files via facebook messenger and it was hard to track changes as the assignment. However, we did mitigate this somewhat, as Daniel Lay has stated by using the Canvas A3 group folder.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">One thing that was surprising to me was the amount of work the group had put it even though we had very chaotic and busy lives. One thing that I have learnt about working in groups is that if a group is productive and understands their roles and what needs to be done, then a project can lead to success and I am very fortunate to have a team that works really well. I have made some new friends from this group.</h7>
<p>

<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">My perception of the group is that every member tried their hardest to ensure that this assignment and assignment 5 the video was done and completed on time, fulfilled the assignment's requirements and that work was distributed as evenly as possible. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The group met up about twice a week or more depending on when we could, We talked over Facebook messenger all the time, we would ask each other questions, put upload work for the group to examine or just talk about the assignment, about where we were at, about how the assignment was going and so for. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Individual members would also talk to each other asking about the assignment or getting feedback about their part of the assignment. I thought the group was extremely supportive of each other and they all helped me enormously.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Daniel Lay</b></h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">I thought our group worked well. Communication was the main factor to our success as there was consistent conversation about planning, ideas and updates on progress. The work was done on a good schedule to allow for improvements and proof-reading by all the team members.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">I think the main improvement that I can think of is more use of GitHub or perhaps a different form of communication. Reason for this is that sometimes, parts of the assignment were uploaded to Facebook messenger and it does get lost in the chat. We did circumvent this somewhat by utilising the Canvas A3 group file sharing board.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">One thing that I found surprising was the amount of work everyone can do in a small timeframe and produce good quality work. It has been a joyful ride as it scooted by rather quickly.
While my experience with this group has been excellent, I can definitely see why I had feared groupwork before. However, I have been gifted a great team and produced, in my opinion, a very decent report. Well done all.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Rhys Burns</b></h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Everyone was able to complete their portion of the assignment in a timely manner and produce some high-quality work. Communication was a driving force of our previous success and it played a pivotal role again for assignment 3.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">In the previous assignment, I mentioned that having a single medium of communication and a platform for idea sharing/document uploads would’ve been ideal. I think using something like Microsoft Teams would’ve provided a good platform to work with, but it would’ve been difficult to introduce this change and learn the platform considering the size and scope of the assignment. As mentioned previously, using a combination of Canvas File Share for document sharing and Facebook Messenger to discuss ideas worked for this assignment.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The team took on board the feedback from the previous assignment and was able to turn what we’d already start producing into what we’ll end up presenting. I believe that the quality of work that is being presented for this assignment is considerably better than what we produced for the previous one. So the surprising factor here was the energy and enthusiasm everyone showed to make the best work possible.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">I learnt that even though we might not all be in the same city, have the same abilities, are as confident in ourselves as others, we can still overcome these hurdles and produce something we can be proud of.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Jayden Barber</b></h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">This assignment has gone relatively smoothly throughout the whole process although there have been a few hiccups. The beginning went very smoothly as we established roles and task early allowing us to get a head start on the assignment. We had regular meetings to check where other members were at and if they needed any assistance with what they were doing. We were lucky enough to have conceptualised a project idea swiftly as this, I feel, might be the hardest part for some groups. However getting closer to the due date communication became a bit more difficult with people being busy, the stress of other classes and impending exams may have put some of the group on edge. In the end, it is not a real issue but is worth mentioning in a group reflection setting. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Overall I think we, as a group, work together well and support each other where needs be. This makes our assignments go extremely smoothly and we get the bulk of the work done far prior to the due date allowing us to edit and add parts where needed.</h7>
