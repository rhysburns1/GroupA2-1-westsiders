      <h5 class="w3-padding-8"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">To have an effective autonomous transport solution that caters to the need of people of various needs and requirements in the community. As many people are unable to access effective transportation due to disability or other circumstances, we’ve decided to do an autonomous bus that can be booked on demand.</h7>

      <center><h3>Roles</h3></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">For this project to be successful in the end, there are certain roles that are required with the expertise inside it for the project to function and deliver the key expectations that are required. The roles that will be required for this project are:</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Software Developers and Engineers -</b> Software developers will be required for the automation to occur. Because automation depends on reliable software in order to run, software developers are needed to develop effective software for the automated bus to run. Also, the software developers are required to develop effective artificial intelligence and machine learning programs and algorithms because automation depends on effective machine learning combined with artificial intelligence due to the dynamic nature of the roads and how rapidly the environment can literally change. (GTI Media, 2014)</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Robotics and Mechatronics Engineers -</b> Robotics and mechatronics engineers are also required for this project to occur successfully. Because this is an automated bus, the robotic and mechatronic engineers are required to develop the automation systems inside the bus that can respond to the dynamic road environment while being able to transport passengers safely. Mechatronic engineers will also integrate existing mechanical knowledge of vehicle and systems into automation so that the vehicle can be controlled automatically without human intervention. (University of New South Wales Engineering, 2019)</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Data and Systems Analyst -</b> The automated bus has a lot of data that needs to be processed such as passenger numbers, road information, bookings, and timetabling, an effective data management system or database is required to manage this amount of data. Also, artificial intelligence requires the data in order to function with machine learning generating more data. In order to manage the ever-growing and changing data a data and systems analyst will develop an effective database to store large amounts of data that will be required for the autonomous bus run while storing the data effectively and efficiently. (GTI Media, 2014)</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Cybersecurity Experts -</b> As with any automated system, it is prone to security threats and cyber-attacks. Throughout the lifetime of this automated system, there is a need for cybersecurity professionals to patch vulnerabilities in the automated system and keep the system up to date with the latest security threats. If a cyber-attack occurs in the automated bus system, it can cause disruption such as a breakdown or a major accident if a hacker was able to take control of the vehicle. Not to mention the loss of public trust and data of customers being lost and stolen which can put the project into disrepute. (GTI Media, 2019)</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Ethic Analysts and Lawyers -</b> The automated bus has a lot of ethical issues not to mention legal issues in the public sphere and the government. An ethics analyst or a lawyer would be required to analyse the ethical and legal issues about autonomous vehicles and ensure that all the legal requirements have been met regarding autonomous vehicles and to resolve legal and ethical issues if they occur such as an accident which can lead to litigation. (Belot, Piper & Kesper, 2018)</h7>

      <center><h3>Scope and Limits</h3></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The outcomes that would be expected out of this project in order to be successful is to have an efficient and effective autonomous community transport solution, however it is important to have several outcomes and objectives that are well planned in order for the ultimate goal to be achieved which is to have an up and running autonomous community bus.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The first goal to be achieved is the design and development of the autonomous community bus and hardware. This is the first step, because the bus wouldn’t exist if it hasn’t been developed yet. The second outcome to be achieved is to begin testing after development in a controlled testing environment on a test track to identify bugs and issues that could affect the operation of the autonomous community bus in the public. The third outcome to be achieved after testing in the controlled environment is to begin testing and trials in a small public space such as a large university campus or a large industrial estate. Before this can occur successfully, legal issues need to be sorted first and approval needs to the sought from the government for trials to begin.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">During the trial period, feedback from users can be incorporated to improve the autonomous bus before being deployed into the general community. Furthermore, this is an opportunity to assess the performance of the community bus in general use and how it performs with passengers responding to the vehicle such as the ramps and interface. The fourth outcome is for deployment into the general community once final approval has been sought from the government. Initially, we plan to deploy the autonomous bus within a community that has high levels of special needs.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">A community we plan on deploying the bus into is the suburb of St Albans, Victoria in Melbourne. St Albans has the highest level of special needs including a large ageing population and disabilities. If the project is successful in this community, we plan to roll the autonomous bus to more suburbs gradually. In short at this point, we would say our project would be successful. However, the success of the project all depends if we are able to make our project commercialised and able to have tendered for autonomous bus solutions as outlined in the plans and progress.</h7>
