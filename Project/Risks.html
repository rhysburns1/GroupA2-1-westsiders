<h7 class="w3-padding-32">When evaluating the risks of this project there are many things that need to be taken into consideration.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">We have identified a few key areas of risk specific to our autonomous bus.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The first risk to this project is the hardware not performing properly or the software not being developed correctly. This could result in the system not working, behaving strangely and have the potential of causing serious harm. Systems controlling the steering, acceleration and braking need to have pin-perfect reliability to certify that the vehicle is safe. Thorough testing is a must! We would mitigate this risk by ensuring that we would identify any bugs during development and thoroughly test along the way during development.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The second risk to our project is not being able to secure funding for our project, running out of funds or running above the budget for development. This is a continual the risk throughout the development and it can be mitigated by determining a roadmap for our project, setting clearly defined goals and using our resources carefully including time. Conducting periodic cost-benefit analyses as well as risk assessments can help catch abnormalities in development cycles and assist in producing the best product.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The third risk to our project is being able to negotiate government approval and ensuring that our vehicles meet government regulations and standards. This risk is very large because if we are not able to meet the legislative requirements for autonomous vehicles or we are unable to seek government approval, then the project will not be able to progress forward developmentally and we can’t deploy our bus into the general community. Ensuring that we plan correctly, and submit our intentions for the project before expensive development begins will help mitigate this. By implementing a strong quality control culture, a focus on meeting laws and legislation will be a priority.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The fourth risk to this project is having a major accident which can lead to the project’s reputation being damaged. This is another big risk and it presents a lot of ethical challenges when it comes to deciding who is at fault and it can cause the public to lose trust in the autonomous bus. Loss of public confidence can have a significant impact on this project because if the public is not confident on an autonomous bus, then it can lead to loss of revenue for our project, not to mention the fallout if the project fails. The ethical and legal challenges would be litigation where our company could be at fault for the accident and the liability for our company would be very high if there was legal action taken. Even though we develop the technologies for this well, accidents can occur and will always occur as on the roadways since technology is not always perfect. Mitigating this risk presents several challenges, but it can be mitigated by having processes in place to resolve legal disputes if accidents occur and keeping our trust in the public by ensuring that our technology is safe and having a response team if an accident does occur.</h7>
