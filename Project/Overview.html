      <center><h3>Topic</h3></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">What the group proposes to do with our project is provide community vehicles that are autonomous in order to serve the communities elderly, disabled, and other people who can’t or do not want to drive that are isolated due to the fact they find it difficult to access public transport. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Initially, we do not want to replace person driven vehicles, but have an additional service that provides support especially to the more vulnerable members of the community. If the project gets to the point where drivers might be in danger of losing jobs, then we will also implement retraining and upskilling for all drivers, plus a guarantee of another job even if it was not driving. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">We feel that having a range of autonomous vehicles would help the community, as many members of our community are isolated due to the fact that they live too far from public transport. This range would include, buses, cars, trams, trains with expansion into the trucking area after that. We see this as the big picture of having a service that will benefit the community as a whole by providing an on-demand, public transport service. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">We also allow ourselves to dream of a range of small autonomous flying vehicles in our future, however, we firstly want the autonomous buses and cars, being tested and used for our community first.</h7>

      <center><h3>Motivation</h3></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The motivation for this project for our group is to step into the future and also keep up with Information Technology trends in addition to the vital goal of wanting to provide a service to those members of our community who are vulnerable and isolated due to the fact they can’t drive and have difficulty accessing public transport. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">People with disabilities, those that suffer from chronic severe illness, the elderly often are unable to drive, and find it hard to access the public transport system the ways it stands currently. This might be due to the fact the person is wheelchair-bound, or in a mobility scoot, or has some other walking aids. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">While some of our public transport buses use suspension to lower themselves down for wheelchairs, by no means are all of them like that. Our hope is to have smaller autonomous community buses capable of lowering themselves down, using their suspension and a retractable ramp that can be used anywhere. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">This project has hit home for several members of our group who have direct knowledge, understanding and experience of accessing public transport with disabilities. Due to this direct experience, our group has a good understanding of how difficult it can be in using public transport with a disability. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Additionally, our group are very future-focused and can see the trends in Information Technology that are important now, but are also going to be very important in the near and distant future.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Autonomous vehicles have been judged by many different sources to be one of the vital technologies that will come and need to be provided for now and in the near distant future. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Working towards these technologies, will help future proof us, but also hopefully provide employment for group members. At the very least working towards these goals will make us more attractive to future employers. It’s safe to say having some understanding of future technologies will make employers look on us with a more favourable eye.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Additionally, the group can see that many autonomous vehicles are starting to come onto the market and the technology to achieve our project is already there, we feel by providing this service we would be in the forefront of technology and in the forefront of many other countries.</h7>

      <center><h3>Landscape</h3></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">At this moment in time, there are already autonomous vehicles starting to be used in Australia by many companies and government companies. One example is the Olli which is being trialled in holdfast bay in Adelaide (Nott,2019). While no autonomous level 5 vehicles yet exists in Australia, there is a push by many companies to get that level of autonomous car into the testing phase. This is our main point of difference of our project compared to the other autonomous vehicles out on the market is to achieve level 5 automation within a couple of years using state of the art, sophisticated technologies to be competitive in the future. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The Australian and New Zealand Driverless Vehicle Initiative (ADVI) is an industry advisory body, that hopes to help the industry with achieving the aims of autonomous vehicles. ADVI states that its mission is to “accelerate the safe and successful introduction of driverless vehicles to Australia”. (ADVI, 2019)</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">ADVI are supported by 120 partners, who are from the automotive, insurance, transport, motoring, parking, communications, banking, logistics, defence, technology and research sectors. ADVI is also supported by many local and state governments, including the federal government. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Currently, our roads system is not set up with autonomous vehicles in mind. Importantly our group will need to look how current and future roads are constructed and the architecture of the roads and the design, how then roads are manufactured, and how other vehicles would interact with autonomous vehicles, and what services might be needed if the autonomous vehicles breakdown. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">New laws are starting to be introduced in federal and state parliaments regarding autonomous vehicles, and ADVI, plus many other industry groups are been asked as to what laws and legislation needs to be in place for autonomous vehicles to start being used. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">“The National Transport Commission (NTC), an independent body that develops regulation for Australia's roads and other transport systems, will be tasked to establish a uniform law around the technology.” (Lieu, 2018)</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">“The NTC has proposed the national regulation will: </h7>
  <li><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Allow an automated driving system (rather than a human) to perform the dynamic driving task when it is engaged </h7></li>
  <li><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Ensure that there is always a legal entity responsible for driving</h7></li>
  <li><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Set out any obligations on relevant entities, including the ADS entity, and users of automated vehicles </h7></li>
  <li><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Provide flexible compliance and enforcement options.” (Lieu, 2018)</h7></li>
