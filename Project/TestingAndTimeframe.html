<h7 class="w3-padding-32">As outlined in the scope of limits, the first stage of testing would begin during the development stage of our project. We would test the technologies for our project including the software and hardware throughout the developmental stage of our project. If there are faults with any hardware or software during the development stage of our project, we would rectify it before we would have a working prototype.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The second stage of testing, once a working prototype has been developed is to test our working prototype in a small test track in a controlled environment as outlined in our scope and limits.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The third stage of testing after faults and bugs has identified in the second stage is to deploy the bus in a small environment such as a University Campus or an Industrial estate. In this environment, we would use public feedback as outlined in the scope and limits to improve our bus and take on feedback before we deploy it into the community. We would also use this opportunity to showcase our project to potential investors and to the public as well, hence we will make our bus open to the public to use as well.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The fourth stage of our project is to deploy our bus into the general community such as St Albans as outlined in the scope and limits. For this to happen, we would need to seek government approval for this to occur and to ensure that our autonomous bus is safe in the general community and on the public roadways.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">After the fourth stage of testing, we would then use the feedback from the general public and identify any further bugs before we come up with our final design.</h7>

<h7 class="w3-padding-32">For this timeframe, this is only a short term timeframe to achieve the project to a point where it can be showcased to shareholders and foundations in order to secure funding or a research grant. Our long term timeframe will be described below.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">After we have secured funding and a few stakeholders, we would start testing and development of our project would take 1-3 years depending on the engineering and research required.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">After development and research, we would then begin field testing in a controlled environment such as a controlled test track. This should take several months to a year to identify and remove any bugs before public trials begin.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Once controlled environment testing has concluded, we would then begin initial public testing which is the third stage of testing. This would take approximately 1-2 years before general community deployment.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">After the third stage of testing, the bus would then begin general community testing which is the fourth stage of testing once approval from the government has been sought. This would be the longest phase of testing, 2-3 years combined with the gradual rollout into more communities. Development of the final design would occur during this timeframe.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Once the final design has been developed, we intend to reach further with our project and commercialise it even further with the aim of winning tenders and contracts across Australia and the world to implement autonomous bus solutions.</h7>
