<h3 class="auto-style2">Reflections</h3>
<p class="auto-style5">Tuan Luong-As a group leader I feel that this group has 
been cooperative with each other and very productive as well. All the group 
members had work together effectively as a team knowing what had to get done and 
every member of the group had an opportunity to play their part in the 
assignment. As a leader, my motivation has played a big factor in getting the 
group together and I’ve set up effective communication processes and channels 
including shared pads, canvas, Facebook and scheduled chats. Through this we 
were able to keep each other updated and on the ball. Many group members were 
anxious at the beginning of the assignment due to groupwork, but due to my 
motivation and continuous feedback to the group, the anxiety had quelled, and 
we’ve moved forward as a group. Furthermore, I had the largest responsibilities 
when leading the group including compiling the final version of the assignment 
and being the group representative with academic staff. It has been a pleasure 
to lead this group. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="auto-style5">As a group I feel we did rather well and became quite 
cohesive towards the end of the assignment period. We got off to a great and 
early start, so we had plenty of time to smooth out any kinks. One such kink 
came in the form of kicking a group member. Unfortunately, one of the other 
members in the group did not have any sort of contact with the rest of the 
members from the get-go, due to this a collective decision was made to remove 
said person from the group and continue as a group of 5. At the beginning 
communication was a bit rocky but that is to be expected and surprisingly 
improved quickly over time. I learned that working is a group is quite easy if 
everyone is committed to getting the task done and helping each other out where 
need be. The people who stepped up into a leading role did an excellent job 
keeping the group on track and offering me personally a lot of help. My personal 
contribution was my profile summary and the industry data on each member ideal 
job and ranking them according to demand against the Burning Glass data 
provided.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="auto-style5">Tuan took the lead on the assignment and showed a high 
level of organisation, whilst maintaining a clear vision of how the assignment 
was progressing. He went out of his way to help others in our group that might 
not be as tech savy and was also happy to chip in if anyone else needed 
assistance with writing or referencing.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5">As a group we were able to complete the overall data 
collection of the assignment after a few online discussions and video calls. 
This was completed in a timely and efficient manner. In the future I feel that 
using one software platform to share ideas and keep each other up to date would 
be more effective. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5">I was surprised that everyone worked well together 
considering this was the first time we’d all worked in a group with each other. 
One thing I learned about group work is that it is possible to contribute ideas 
and have your voice heard despite only ever joining in via video call or via 
messenger, as I’m located in NSW and the rest of the group in VIC.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span><span class="auto-style5">I think our group worked well together. 
Everyone was on the same page and very easy to get along with. Everyone had put 
in their share of the project so it was nice to see the teamwork. Something that 
could be improved could be more communication, but I understand we are all very 
busy and to be fair, communication was concise!</span><br class="auto-style5" />
<span class="auto-style5">One thing I learned about groups is, I’m not too bad 
in one! It also went a lot smoother than I thought which is always a plus.</span><br class="auto-style5" />
<span class="auto-style5">In regards to the log of activity, we had opted to 
separate the tasks and allocate each person to a couple, which worked out well. 
However, in regards to making the website, I was not involved nor needed.</span><br class="auto-style5" />
<span class="auto-style5">Overall, I am very happy with my group and the project 
we put forth. </span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span class="auto-style5">Melissa Eder Group reflection.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5">I felt the group worked well. The communication was open 
and honest, but it was also empowering and supportive. The group used whatsapp 
and Facebook messenger video chat to talk and discuss how we would handle 
assignment two.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5">We had one group member Nickolai Soluk who none of the 
rest of the group could get in contact with him.&nbsp; We did not know why we 
couldn’t contact him, but unfortunately we had to state that he did not 
contribute to the assignment.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5">The group was unsure why this was the case, so we state 
that for reasons unknown Nickolai could not contribute to the group, but we 
sincerely hope he is okay and we wish him well in his future.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span><span class="auto-style5"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Tuan our group leader was 
excellent at keeping our group focused and on task, but also very supportive 
when we needed help with a part of the assignment.&nbsp; Tuan showed very strong 
leadership skills, and through him we have an assignment we all could be proud 
of.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5">The rest of the group we magnificently support of myself 
and others.&nbsp; The group functioned really well together and I feel that we 
will function well in assignment three and five.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span><span class="auto-style5">Myself I found the work hard, I am in my 
fifties and its been a very long time since I did anything related to computers.&nbsp; 
Additionally, my physical health is extremely poor.&nbsp; I have severe chronic 
chest infections, and there were times I could do any work.&nbsp; I also can’t 
walk very well due to 4 prolapsed discs in my back.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="auto-style5">However, the group, especially Tuan was very supportive.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5">Tools and collaboration within the group-Tuan<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style5">For our group we met regularly to discuss the tasks that 
needed to be done. What we have discussed is outlined in the minutes I’ve 
written down has been uploaded to our repository. Also, we used ether pad to 
communicate and delegate the required tasks that needed to be done. We 
collaborated our files through both Facebook messenger and the canvas file 
upload in our group. I was responsible for the final editing and compiling of 
the assignment once I have received each group member’s part of the assignment. <o:p></o:p>
