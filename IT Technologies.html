<p><span><span class="auto-style2">Cloud, Services and Servers-Rhys Burns<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">What does it do?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span><span class="auto-style2"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The Cloud, Services associated 
with the Cloud and the Servers that provide the infrastructure hardware needs to 
keep it all going can be a confronting topic to understand, therefore it needs 
to be defined. The Cloud or Cloud Computing is often defined as an on-demand 
computing system that is made available over the internet (Microsoft Azure, 
2019)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">. Services associated with the cloud include Software As 
A Service (SaaS), Platform As A Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure As A Service 
(IaaS), these will be defined and discussed in further detail. A Server is a 
type of computer which manages access to centralised resources or services in a 
network, a server can be virtual or physical (Microsoft Azure, 2019). <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="auto-style2">One of the latest pieces of technology that is being 
developed around Cloud Computing has been created by Unity, who are better known 
for developing engines for video games. They are currently developing a 
cloud-based simulation software that allows customers to run simulations on 
hardware that is connected via the cloud. This will revolutionise the workflows 
required for robotics and self-driving car companies who need a platform to test 
and train their programs (TechCrunch, 2019).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span><span class="auto-style2">Traditionally there are three services that 
make up Cloud Computing, SaaS is a service that offers software delivery and 
licensing that is hosted on the cloud, which is accessible via subscription, for 
example Office 365 (Azure.microsoft.com, 2019). PaaS offers hardware and 
software tools over the internet, usually for application development, for 
example Microsoft Azure (Azure.microsoft.com, 2019). IaaS offers cloud-base 
services, storage, networking and virtualization, companies like Rackspace offer 
hosting and support for these services (Azure.microsoft.com, 2019).<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The future of Cloud Computing, it’s services and the 
servers that keep everything running is limitless. Recently, Oracle released 
their “Cloud Predictions” which provides information for where the technology 
will be heading in the next 5 years. One of the most ambitious predictions that 
was made was that “second-generation cloud providers will offer 100% data centre 
replacement”. This sort of change means that hardware and software reliability 
will be on par with dedicated hardware and on-premise software which is used in 
a lot of businesses today. Second-generation cloud offers the ability to handle 
complex workloads and mission-critical systems (Oracle.com, 2019).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span><span class="auto-style2">With Cloud Computing will come the increased 
demand for Engineers, IT Professionals, Developers, Security Experts and many 
others to fill the skilled void. Businesses that have already made the switch to 
the Cloud are looking for skilled professionals of every calibre. Most people 
looking for work in the future will needs to be able to demonstrate mastery of 
important cloud concepts and technologies, this is not just limited to IT, but 
to all industries that have a digital footprint (Cloud Academy, 2019).
<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The hardware that makes Cloud Computing what it is, and 
the technology handled by SaaS, PaaS and IaaS needs to be reliable, powerful and 
fast. HPE is a global authority on Cloud Computing hardware, they offer some of 
the fastest, most powerful and reliable servers on the market. Their latest 
offering of Hyper-converged servers has been built to handle the complex 
workloads that Cloud Computing presents (Hpe.com, 2019). Recently in North 
America, Google has introduced some of the fastest internet offerings in the 
world with the introduction of Google fibre (Fiber.google.com, 2019), meanwhile 
in Australia, Telstra and Optus have begun rolling out the latest and greatest 
offering of mobile internet with the introduction of the 5G network 
(Telstra.com.au, 2019). Having this sort of internet connectivity in place 
allows not just for businesses to have access to Cloud Computing, but also 
people who want to immerse themselves into the Cloud. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">What is the likely Impact?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span><span class="auto-style2"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The impact of this technology for 
business is huge, every year the Cloud Computing adoption stats continue to 
rise. This is due to a number of technological benefits, but the biggest 
contributing factor is how affordable the Cloud is and how much money businesses 
that move to the Cloud are saving (Hosting Tribunal, 2019). </span><o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">With this much adoption and change, educational 
institutions need to prepare students for the workforce of the near future. RMIT 
has begun offering Cloud Computing courses that has a focus on educating those 
who want to prepare for the future of technology by offering AWS training and 
pathways to becoming certified (Brookes, 2019).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The demands for workers to have a solid understanding of 
Cloud Computing is growing as rapidly as it’s adaptation. Workers in IT customer 
support need to be knowledgeable in SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, as well as support any 
in-house software that their employee may use. As the knowledge base continues 
to grow, already skilled IT workers need to remain educated and up to date with 
the developing technology (Pmc.gov.au, 2019). <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">As Cloud Computing continues to grow, businesses of all 
sizes are needing to move into the Cloud and off their own hardware and in-house 
software. Businesses that are utilizing the Cloud and incorporating it into 
their business model are growing rapidly, whereas those who aren’t using it are 
plateauing or losing business (Inspired Techs, 2019).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">With the above in mind as long as businesses are 
utilizing Cloud Computing and its associated services, there will be a lot of 
jobs for those workers who have stayed up to date with technology. 
Unfortunately, if a business doesn’t adapt and adopt Cloud Computing into their 
business or if an IT worker doesn’t learn or understand Cloud Computing then 
they will eventually run into trouble. The same applies for software companies 
who don’t modify their software to work with SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">How will this affect you?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Cloud computing has already started to affect how I 
access various services and how I work day-to-day. I already use products that 
utilize SaaS, I work on products that utilize PaaS and the company I work for is 
a managed hosting company that utilizes and provides IaaS. When I first started 
my career in IT, a lot of these services didn’t exist or were not as well-known 
as they are today. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Professionally, I work at the front line of this 
particular-technology. For now, my current knowledge is up to date enough with 
the technology that is used at Rack space, however, with the adoption of virtual 
network devices this will need to change. I will have to undertake courses, 
training and become certified in order to maintain my knowledge and relevance in 
Cloud Computing. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Most of my friends work in a variety of disciplines 
within IT, for them, a lot of the companies they work for all use Cloud 
Computing in some variety. I feel that a lot of IT professionals that are my in 
my age range are keeping up to date with technology and are actively pursuing 
knowledge in Cloud Computing. For my family, using this technology makes their 
lives easier. They can use the cloud to store their photos and videos, they use 
streaming services to watch movies and TV shows, and my family members that 
aren’t working in IT are needing to learn this new technology to stay relevant. <o:p></o:p>

tokens.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Accountability keeps a record of who has accessed the

possible because the sensors and software are able to detect many of the hazards 
that are currently present on our roadways and calculate the required actions in 
order to operate the vehicle safely and deal with sudden situations and changes 
that occurs on the roadways. Within the next decade, we should see autonomous 
vehicles on our roads, primarily on our major highways (Grover, 2018). Currently 
the Australian government is working to make level 3 autonomous vehicles 
operational on public roads by 2020 (Australian Government Department of 
Infrastructure, 2019).</span><span class="auto-style6" lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;

control speed steering and monitor road conditions but require a fallback driver 
to take control (Grover, 2018). An ethical issue with autonomous vehicles is the 
legal implications of who is responsible for an accident of whether to blame the 
company or the owner of the autonomous vehicle if an accident occurs as a result 
of a computer glitch or error (Belot, Piper and Kesper, 2018). The technological 
advances in sensors, electronics and software systems has allowed robots to rise 
very quickly and become a prominent part of our society where they are gradually 
becoming part of our daily lives. Robotics are </span>

revolution where the society we live in has been impacted greatly by the rise of 
robots that will change the way we operate as a society from jobs, recreation,

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">With the current rise in robotics and 
automation, we are starting to see a lot of the jobs that are currently done 
becoming gradually and gradually extinct since robotic technology can do these 
jobs (Archer, 2018). The jobs most at risk from automation and robotics are jobs 
that repetitive, routine and require least creativity and innovation because of 
the robot’s ability to perform this repetitive and routine tasks sequentially 
using pre-defined programs and parameters (Archer, 2018). Some examples of jobs 
that will be at risk is cleaner, cashiers, fast food cooks, data entry clerks, 
factory assembly and a lot of manual labour work in construction (Archer, 2018). 
With autonomous vehicles, a lot of jobs will be redundant in the transportation 
industry such as train, bus and truck drivers. Because autonomous vehicles can’t 
get fatigued, tired and can potentially reduce human error with bad driving, 
industries are replacing drivers altogether to minimize the impact of the road 
toll caused by poor driving performance. Another impact autonomous vehicle will 
have in transportation is a potential loss of driving skills and driving schools 
due to autonomous vehicles doing the work. However even though there is a lot of 
anxiety regarding the change of jobs and what we will do in the future, there is 
new jobs being created with the rise in robotics (Archer, 2018). These jobs 
require a high level of creativity, innovation and intelligence. Also, for the 
potential loss in driving skills, driving schools should continue to operate, 
but should change the focus on how to both drive and manage autonomous driving 
in case of error. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

change of jobs, the economy will also likely change as well with the rise in 
automation as well because new sectors will likely develop in the robotic age 
and the economy will start to embrace the boom in the rise of robotics from the 
development of robots to the production of robots as well (Gaskell, 2018). Also, 
education will also change as well because with the rise in robotics, new skills 
are likely to be required as well in order to keep up with the rise in robotics. 
One important skill that will likely be needed in the future is the ability to 
code across many different languages because in order to function, robotics 
require programmers that will develop effective software solutions for robotics 
(Blannin, 2017). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
