<b><p><span class="auto-style2">Autonomous Community BUS</span><span class="auto-style2" lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p></b>
<p class="auto-style2">The project we have in mind autonomous community bus.&nbsp; 
Our idea is to have a community bus, like the buses used for public transport 
Victoria. &nbsp;&nbsp;These community buses will have suspension that can lower itself and 
has an extendable ramp for scooters and wheelchairs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">People would be able to use PC or mobile phone app or 
dial up and book this bus for themselves.&nbsp; A 22-seat bus would be a good 
size or could use the standard public transport bus (Remark Paringa Council, 
2019).&nbsp; The bus would also have an ability to be remotely controlled.&nbsp; 
The bus would also have interactive with speakers and microphone so that 
passengers could ask any questions and hear any needed instructions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">When using the app or phoning to book a bus, the system 
will find the community bus nearest to the person that is free or available to 
take them and use a combination of google maps and VicRoads traffic to find the 
person and then making the bus go to that address (Marshall, 2017).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Therefore, the system will require that the autonomous 
buses constantly report where they are, their status, as in transit, who is on 
them and where they are going (Transdev Australasia, 2019). At first at least I 
think humans will have to have a high level of input, even if it’s using the 
microphones and speakers to interact with the passengers.&nbsp; Once in transit 
the bus would take the person to their destination.&nbsp; At first destination 
would have to be in a set community area, such as shops, post office, banks and 
so forth.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The buses as well as having suspension that can lower it 
to street level and an automatic extending ramp, would have to be equipped with 
a full array of sensors, forward, back, sides, above and under, with automatic 
sensing of other vehicles (Nott, 2019). The vehicles would be clearly marked and 
a certain colour, say green to let everyone know they are autonomous vehicles.&nbsp; 
An advertising campaign letting people know that these buses are now on the 
roads, how to order one and so forth would also be done, to help inform the 
community as well as a dedicated web site with detailed information on the 
service (Nott, 2019).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">We envision that these community buses be able to be 
remotely controlled, and obviously the buses would operate over encrypted 
channels to try and avoid hacking or the system.&nbsp; We envision this being a 
free service, with funding to be provided by a combination of local, state and 
federal.&nbsp; A fleet of 20 to 30 to start with, with that being built up, with 
the aim of having in the hundreds if not the 1000’s eventually.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">These buses will also have to make decisions based on the 
safety of its uses, others on the road and the general community.&nbsp; We see 
the following hierarchy of needs in our systems:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><![if !supportLists]><span class="auto-style2">1. </span><![endif]>
<span class="auto-style2">&nbsp;The safety of bus passengers would be highest 
priority<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><![if !supportLists]><span class="auto-style2">2. </span><![endif]>
<span class="auto-style2">Next pedestrians have next level of priority.&nbsp; 
One might think that pedestrians might be the highest, but we feel that the 
safety of the people on the bus must be higher as otherwise people will not use 
the system<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><![if !supportLists]><span class="auto-style2">3. </span><![endif]>
<span class="auto-style2">Other vehicles<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><![if !supportLists]><span class="auto-style2">4. </span><![endif]><span>
<span class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style4">The general community and 
the public best interest.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Also once operating, these buses will come up with 
situations that we might need to know how to solve. For instance, what occurs if 
one is in an accident (Marshall, 2017)?&nbsp; Our policy would be that unless 
the bus is mechanically or otherwise not able to function, it should finish its 
trip then return to base for any repairs or service.&nbsp; This would cause 
issues with insurance, and this is where having cameras recording information, 
it would be able to determine if the accident was the fault of the autonomous 
vehicle or other vehicles. Obviously the buses wold have to have extended 
insurance to cover any issues should they occur (Marshall, 2017). Having the 
buses clearly marked and numbered will also help in the claims of any accident 
damage.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Another issue that might come up is a medical emergency 
of someone on board.&nbsp; If someone were to have a medical emergency, then 
emergency services need to be informed and diverted to the bus so the person can 
get medical care.&nbsp; Also, if we are to use 22 seat buses, then only a few 
wheelchairs or scooters will fill it, so when booking or using the app, 
passengers would need to stipulate if they are using wheelchairs, scooters or 
other walking assistance technologies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The buses would also require fuel, most likely diesel or 
battery operated, with that being monitored, to ensure that the fuel tank or 
battery is always at least half full. Also, the vehicles will require cleaning 
and general maintenance, which would occur at the end of day in specialized 
workshops.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The aim would not be to replace the public transport 
Victoria system, but to complement it (Remark Paringa Council, 2019).&nbsp; 
Also, after community buses, community cars, would be another goal of our 
organization. To have like an automated uber system run by us for the same 
reasons as a community bus.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span><span class="auto-style2">So android, iPhone app, PC app, ability to 
call in and book via web site and so on are all vital. There is an initial 
outlay, but after that they system will save money, provide a much-needed 
service, and improve the lives of the elderly and disabled (Transdev 
Australasia, 2019)</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
