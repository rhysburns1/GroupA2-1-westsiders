      <center><h1>Group Process</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">After the group was first formed for Assignment 2, Tuan put himself forward as the group leader, and everyone was happy to let him lead for the first Assignment. He acted as a group motivator and was the group representative with the academic staff. Tuan will remain the group leader for Assignment 3.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">There was a lot of debate on how the team will communicate throughout Assignment 2. It was decided very earlier on that Facebook Messenger was the desired platform to share ideas and organise meetings, WhatsApp was used for team members unable to join group meetings in person, and this process will remain the same for Assignment 3. For our files, we uploaded them onto our canvas group folder and shared them via facebook, which was effective for our group.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">From the start communication wasn’t an issue for most of the team members, one team member left the Facebook Messenger early on in Assignment 2 and there were many attempts to contact them. We will be continuing as a group of 5 going into Assignment 3. We felt that despite being one short on a team member we were all able to pull it all together and get the job done.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">One change that has been introduced since the completion of Assignment 2 is to organise meetings with an agenda and to have a representative taking minutes so team members who can’t join can review the notes. This is also supported via video chat once per week using WhatsApp.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">We also took on the advice from Assignment 2 in regards to formatting and proof-reading to ensure that we don’t miss any content as well as maintaining consistency. We achieved this by having Daniel combine out individual works together, clean up the formatting and grammar check.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Overall our group worked really well, and there won’t be any major changes.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The group remained unchanged from assignment 2, which allowed us to be able to keep to the same group format for assignment 3 and assignment 5. The group also looked at the feedback from the tutors at RMIT and discussed how we could improve on the other two assignments.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The first thing the group did, was an enormous amount of research into the project idea for this assignment. We first laid out rough ideas and plans for the assignment. There would be discussion when an idea was suggested, weighing up the pros and cons as well as feasibility and suitability. Once we had the bulk of the content completed, we then started working on the process of refining the report.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Using Sparkplus and feedback from assignment two, we carefully read the rubric for these assignments and went through the process to ensure we had answered every point and question in the assignment. The group was keen to improve on our score for assignment two, and taking the feedback to heart, we reviewed the rubric and the assignment to try and ensure that we had successfully met all criteria.</h7>
