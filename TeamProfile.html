      <center><h1>Let’s meet the TransForMation team!</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"></h5>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Rhys Burns (s3815633):</b> I have an IT background; I work as a network security administrator and have a background in data centres and front-line support. In my free time I travel, spend time outdoors and play video games. My main interests in IT are in large scale networking, network security and automation. The name TransForMation is a combination of the words Transport, Forward (the future) and Automation, which captures the idea of our group project for an autonomous bus. </h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Tuan Luong (s3652729): </b> I love all things technological and how they work around me. I have a limited working IT background; the majority of my experiences comes from troubleshooting computer hardware in various roles. My background is Vietnamese, I moved to Australia in 2002 and gained my citizenship status in 2006. My hobbies are anything water-related, swimming, diving and staying fit by going to the gym and riding my bike. My Interests in IT are software engineering, programming and network engineering.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Melissa Eder (s3414696):</b> I am part aboriginal, a mother of four, a grandmother of two and in the past worked in the IT industry, however, I have not worked in IT since 2002. I had various roles whilst I was working IT, my main responsibilities were hardware repairs, network cabling, network software installation and programming. I have decided to return to studying IT to reignite my passion for the industry, but at this point, I am not sure if I can return to work as I suffer from chronic health issues.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Jayden Barber (s3812572):</b>  I am originally from Queensland, but moved to Melbourne to follow my dreams and pursue a career in IT. My interests stem growing up around technology, but my true passion came from playing video games. I am a naturally shy person, so having a platform that allows me to play video games whilst meeting others online enabled me to be more outgoing and engaging. My hands-on experiences with IT are limited and specifically towards video games.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Daniel Lay (s3286525):</b>  I was born in Australia from an East Timorese background. I am married and a father of two. I work as a car mechanic have been doing this for almost 10 years now. My interests in IT are cybersecurity, programming and overclocking, I also like building computers and cars in my spare time. I have no prior experience in IT but I am currently undertaking a Certificate IV in Cybersecurity and I have broadened my knowledge in networking and security. </h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Nickolai Sokaluk:</b> Unfortunately, due to reason the rest of team are unaware of, Nickolai was not able to participate in or contribute to the group assignment and as such we are unable to credit him with any work done.  The entire team has tried to contact Nickolai, with no success and we the rest of the team hope he is well and we wish him all the best in his future studies and/or IT career.</h7>

      <center><h1>Career Plans</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"></h5>
<center><b><h5 class="w3-padding-32">Rhys Burns</h5></b></center>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Reflecting on the Burning Glass data from assignment 2, my career plans as a Senior Network Engineer, Data Centre have not changed. As I continue working towards the completion of my undergraduate, I hope to major in Networking as this is my current field of expertise.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">I am currently working as a Network Security Administrator for a large Cloud Solutions Provider, I’ve also been working in the industry for nearly 10 years in a variety of roles across 2 large companies. Whilst I complete my undergraduate, I’ll also be aiming towards completing a CCNA and CCNP, a CCA-N and CCP-N (Citrix Networking) and a PCCSA and PCNSA (Palo Alto Networking). I’ll also be hoping to certify my knowledge with Python, Java or C#, but this is not a priority for me.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">By the time I have completed my undergraduate, I will have the relevant experience and qualifications that are required for a Senior Network engineering.</h7>
<p>
<center><b><h5 class="w3-padding-32">Melissa Eder</h5></b></center>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">My ideal job has changed from assignment 2, in that now my ideal job would be a part-time job working from home. Due to serious health complications, I would have difficulty in accessing full-time work out of the home.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">My career plans have altered from assignment 2. My career plans are at this time to learn programming and web design in order to be in a better position to find work. I want to finish the Bachelor of Information Technology plus I also want to study subjects from other It courses and other fields. I would like to study cybersecurity and many others. Safe to say that if I look for a job, it’s going to be working from home and in the distant future as I seek to improve my skills.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Only after I have improved upon my skills significantly will I be attractive to employers. I also am thinking about offering to do something free to improve my work experience.</h7>
<p>
<center><b><h5 class="w3-padding-32">Daniel Lay</h5></b></center>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">My career plans are still directed towards cybersecurity space. I plan to finish off my Certificate IV in Cyber Security and then perhaps obtain CCNA certification to increase the likelihood of getting a job in the IT world. I am hoping to get into a junior security analyst role or similar to start building my portfolio for an IT career.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Whilst working in an IT-related job, I aim to finish my Bachelor in IT with RMIT and with that, get a more senior/advanced role. I definitely see it taking baby steps, but I am positive my motivation will get me to the dream job of a security architect.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Another career path that has also gained my interest, is in programming. I enjoyed my short time with Python, and have been enjoying the challenges in the Introduction to Programming subject learning about Java. I can also see myself leaning towards a programming career path too.</h7>
<p>
<center><b><h5 class="w3-padding-32">Jayden Barber</h5></b></center>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">My career plan as of now is to continue with the Bachelor of IT through RMIT and branch off into either game design or software engineering sometime in the future. In terms of the games design path, I would ideally like to start at a small start-up to learn the ropes of the industry and get my feet firmly planted. After which I would like to move onto one of the big companies’ design teams such as Blizzard Games, Riot Games, Square Enix, or Bethesda. These are obviously idealistic aspirations but that is the reason I am following this path.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">As for the software engineering path I have connections in the online betting industry which I would take advantage of, getting a job in that industry with a mentor would be very advantageous for me later in life and the earlier I can get there the better. I am also inquiring about an internship/placement in this field to help solidify my skills here. This would require me to learn a lot of the high demand skills from the Burning Glass data which will make my skill set desirable across many jobs.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Both these paths hinge off me finishing my current degree so that will be my focus for the foreseeable future.</h7>
<p>
<center><b><h5 class="w3-padding-32">Tuan Luong</h5></b></center>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">From assignment 2, my career plan has changed. In my opinion, I feel it’s a bit early to decide what path I am going to take down the road of IT. However, having experienced the Introduction to Programming, I would like to work in programming and software development because I am able to utilise my skills a bit better with my attention to detail, high concentration and critical thinking. I am also thinking of exploring software testing where the work is in a predictable and structured routine. It would allow me to use my attention to detail to the highest standard to debug and test software. Due to my Asperger’s, a task that I can just focus strongly on a for long periods of time would be ideal for me. Furthermore, I would also like to do networking and gain my CCNA from Cisco to broaden my opportunities.

<h7 class="w3-padding-32">As for my ideal job, I would still consider helpdesk support roles, ideally as a communication and technical Services officer for the MFB, or the CFA. However, I would rather prefer an environment where there are less people because of my social anxiety disorder, which could be a problem when handling customers.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The role of a communication technical services officer involves maintaining the IT networks and databases of the emergency services department. This role appeals to me because I can still help people, but in a more technical position.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">I have also considered becoming a firefighter in Queensland or Melbourne and by starting as a CTSO it will give me an insight into the fire services in how they function and work while gaining valuable experience.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">If I don’t get into the fire service because of the competitive nature of selection, I plan to pursue
underwater photography working in tourism in Queensland while working as a software engineer or
  tester to pursue my passion with the underwater world. </h7>
  <p>

  <div class="w3-content">
      <center><h1>Comparison of Career Plans</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">The obvious similarity in our career plans is the course we are all doing. Although they might differ
slightly, we are all attending an IT course at RMIT to further our position in the future. Rhys currently
holds a position in the industry but is working to increase his knowledge and skills in his current
  position. Daniel currently works as a mechanic, but is wanting a career change into IT. </h7>
    <p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">There is not much to differentiate our career plans from each other besides the actual careers we are choosing to pursue. Mel’s health requirement causing her to focus on more part-time work or working from home is the only real outlying contributor to our career plans difference. There could be a point made for the specific skills people have mentioned in their individual career plan. Some of us have a very clear plan and know exactly what skills they want to learn such as Rhys and Daniel whilst others are much more open-ended like Jayden and Tuan.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Overall our career plans are fairly diverse and cover a lot of fields in IT. From cybersecurity to game design and even customer service, there is a vast array of skills we have to cover as a group. Some of us have worked in the industry for over a decade while others are just starting to break into it. This lends the group a diverse range of viewpoints which help make our work more rounded and seems to allow us to work together quite smoothly.</h7>
