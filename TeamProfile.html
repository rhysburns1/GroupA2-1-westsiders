      <center><h1>Let’s meet the TransForMation team!</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"></h5>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Rhys Burns (s3815633):</b> I have an IT background; I work as a network security administrator and have a background in data centres and front-line support. In my free time I travel, spend time outdoors and play video games. My main interests in IT are in large scale networking, network security and automation. The name TransForMation is a combination of the words Transport, Forward (the future) and Automation, which captures the idea of our group project for an autonomous bus. </h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Tuan Luong (s3652729): </b> I love all things technological and how they work around me. I have a limited working IT background; the majority of my experiences comes from troubleshooting computer hardware in various roles. My background is Vietnamese, I moved to Australia in 2002 and gained my citizenship status in 2006. My hobbies are anything water-related, swimming, diving and staying fit by going to the gym and riding my bike. My Interests in IT are software engineering, programming and network engineering.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Melissa Eder (s3414696):</b> I am part aboriginal, a mother of four, a grandmother of two and in the past worked in the IT industry, however, I have not worked in IT since 2002. I had various roles whilst I was working IT, my main responsibilities were hardware repairs, network cabling, network software installation and programming. I have decided to return to studying IT to reignite my passion for the industry, but at this point, I am not sure if I can return to work as I suffer from chronic health issues.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Jayden Barber (s3812572):</b>  I am originally from Queensland, but moved to Melbourne to follow my dreams and pursue a career in IT. My interests stem growing up around technology, but my true passion came from playing video games. I am a naturally shy person, so having a platform that allows me to play video games whilst meeting others online enabled me to be more outgoing and engaging. My hands-on experiences with IT are limited and specifically towards video games.</h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Daniel Lay (s3286525):</b>  I was born in Australia from an East Timorese background. I am married and a father of two. I work as a car mechanic have been doing this for almost 10 years now. My interests in IT are cybersecurity, programming and overclocking, I also like building computers and cars in my spare time. I have no prior experience in IT but I am currently undertaking a Certificate IV in Cybersecurity and I have broadened my knowledge in networking and security. </h7>
<p>
<b><h7 class="w3-padding-32">Nickolai Sokaluk:</b> Unfortunately, due to reason the rest of team are unaware of, Nickolai was not able to participate in or contribute to the group assignment and as such we are unable to credit him with any work done.  The entire team has tried to contact Nickolai, with no success and we the rest of the team hope he is well and we wish him all the best in his future studies and/or IT career.</h7>

      <center><h1>Group Process</h1></center>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"></h5>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">After the group was first formed for Assignment 2, Tuan put himself forward as the group leader, and everyone was happy to let him lead for the first Assignment. He acted as a group motivator and was the group representative with the academic staff. Tuan will remain the group leader for Assignment 3.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">There was a lot of debate on how the team will communicate throughout Assignment 2. It was decided very earlier on that Facebook Messenger was the desired platform to share ideas and organise meetings, WhatsApp was used for team members unable to join group meetings in person, and this process will remain the same for Assignment 3. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">From the start communication wasn’t an issue for most of the team members, one team member left the Facebook Messenger early on in Assignment 2 and there were many attempts to contact them. We will be continuing as a group of 5 going into Assignment 3. We felt that despite being one short on a team member we were all able to pull it all together and get the job done.</h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">One change that has been introduced since the completion of Assignment 2 is to organise meetings with an agenda and to have a representative taking minutes so team members who can’t join can review the notes. This is also supported via video chat once per week using WhatsApp.
We also took on the advice from Assignment 2 in regards to formatting and proof-reading to ensure that we don’t miss any content as well as maintaining consistency. We achieved this by having Daniel combine out individual works together, clean up the formatting and grammar check. </h7>
<p>
<h7 class="w3-padding-32">Overall our group worked really well, and there won’t be any major changes.</h7>
